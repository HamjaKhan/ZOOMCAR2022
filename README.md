It works on the principle of “Self-driving” If you visit some random city but you don’t like to pay for cabs or want your vehicle to roam then Zoomcar is the best option.

## Problems faced and Solution Resolved

It was a challenging journey for all our team members. We just had a week to complete this project and we faced a lot of problems as it was our first project. The first thing we got stuck is How to start?. The main problem we faced is Time management. The only aim is to complete our project within the desired time.

The first we have done is going through the website and then we planned and decided to distribute the parts, roles, and the responsibility to each one and we supported each other by clearing the queries that others have.

    
## Mastering

we learned a lot of things in this project, this helps us to deepen our knowledge and understanding of issues. we were exposed to a variety of perspectives. And improved our vocabulary. we learned how to teach and manage personalities. and learned to listen to other suggestions which may be better than ours and also learn how to work with them.
